### Petrol Hatchback – City Driving Cheat-Sheet

| Parameter | Normal | Warning | Critical |
|----------|--------|---------|----------|
| Coolant temperature (°C) | 85–100 | 101–110 | > 110 |
| Oil pressure (bar) | ≥ 1.0 idle, ≥ 2.0 cruise | – | < 1.0 idle |
| Idle speed (rpm) | 650–800 | 800–900 | < 600 or > 1200 |

**Common complaints & likely causes**

1. **Jerky low-speed driving in traffic**
   * Possible: riding the clutch, wrong gear selection, dirty throttle body, minor misfire.
   * Checks:
     - Observe rpm while moving off; teach smooth clutch release with light throttle.
     - Check for check-engine light and scan for misfire codes.
     - Inspect throttle body and air filter for dirt.

2. **Poor fuel economy in city**
   * Possible: very short trips, aggressive acceleration, under-inflated tyres, dragging brakes, overdue service.
   * Checks:
     - Review driving pattern: frequent full-throttle starts, high rpm in low gears.
     - Measure tyre pressures vs door-sticker spec.
     - After a short drive, feel each wheel for excessive heat (possible dragging brake).
     - Verify service history (engine oil, air filter, spark plugs).

3. **Engine overheating in slow traffic**
   * Possible: radiator fan not working, low coolant, clogged radiator, running A/C at idle for long periods.
   * Checks:
     - Confirm fan operation as coolant approaches 100 °C.
     - Inspect coolant level and visible leaks.
     - Advise on switching A/C off and gently moving airflow through radiator if safe.

4. **Steering pulling to one side**
   * Possible: tyre pressure imbalance, alignment issue, uneven tyre wear, sticking brake caliper.
   * Checks:
     - Compare tyre pressures left vs right.
     - Visually inspect tread wear pattern.
     - On an empty, safe road, lightly release steering at 40–60 km/h and observe drift.

**Driving best practices**

* Use the highest gear that keeps the engine smooth (typically 1,500–2,500 rpm for petrol).
* Avoid riding the clutch at signals; use neutral + handbrake instead.
* Do not rest your foot on the clutch pedal while cruising (prevents premature clutch wear).
* Check tyres at least once a month; correct pressure improves safety and fuel economy.
* Warm the engine gently: drive off smoothly instead of idling for a long time.
