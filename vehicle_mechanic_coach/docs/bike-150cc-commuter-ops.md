### 150 cc Commuter Motorcycle – City Riding Notes

| Parameter | Normal | Warning | Critical |
|----------|--------|---------|----------|
| Engine temperature (°C, if sensed) | 80–105 | 106–115 | > 115 |
| Idle speed (rpm) | 1,200–1,400 | 1,000–1,200 or 1,400–1,600 | < 1,000 or > 1,600 |
| Chain slack (mm) | 20–30 | 30–40 | < 10 or > 40 |

**Common complaints & likely causes**

1. **Chain noise and jerkiness on throttle on/off**
   * Possible: dry or loose chain, severely worn sprockets, misaligned rear wheel.
   * Checks:
     - Inspect chain slack at midpoint between sprockets.
     - Check for tight spots by rotating the wheel and re-measuring slack.
     - Look for hooked teeth on sprockets (sign of wear).

2. **Poor low-speed control in traffic**
   * Possible: riding only rear brake, harsh clutch release, wrong gear choice.
   * Coaching:
     - Use gentle throttle with partial clutch slip only when necessary.
     - Combine light front + rear brake for better stability.
     - Stay in 1st/2nd gear for walking-speed traffic, avoid lugging in higher gears.

3. **Front-end wobble or instability**
   * Possible: low front tyre pressure, worn head bearings, uneven load (heavy luggage).
   * Checks:
     - Confirm tyre pressures vs spec.
     - With front wheel lifted, gently move handlebar lock-to-lock feeling for notches.
     - Review rider posture and luggage placement.

4. **Weak braking performance**
   * Possible: glazed pads/shoes, contaminated rotor/drum, spongy hydraulic line, poor technique.
   * Checks:
     - Inspect pads/shoes for glazing, measure wear.
     - Explain progressive front brake use and weight transfer.

**Riding best practices**

* Look far ahead, not only at the front wheel; plan for braking and gear changes early.
* Use both brakes, with a bias to the front on good surface; avoid grabbing the front brake mid-corner.
* Keep chain cleaned and lubricated; check slack every few weeks.
* Avoid full-throttle starts and repeated redline runs on a cold engine.
* Wear proper safety gear (helmet, gloves, jacket) even for short trips.
