### RS200 – Refinement Separator Cheat-Sheet

* **Baseline vibration**  
  *Idle* < 1 mm s⁻¹ *Run* < 3 mm s⁻¹ (ref. RSE-200 handbook).  
* **Common faults**  
  1. Bowl-neck erosion ⇒ gradual loss of separation efficiency, manifested as rising turbidity in light phase and 0.5 mm s⁻¹ increase at 2× RPM.  
  2. Differential-pressure spikes during neutralisation cycle cause off-balance sludge plug – clear by running 2 min in *Clarify* mode.  
* **Bearing watch-points** – Lower thrust bearing warms faster (Δ T ≈ +8 °C vs upper).  
* **Cleaning-in-place** – Total desludging via front PLC button “Total De-sludge” (manual §3.4).  :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
